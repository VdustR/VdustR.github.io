### Fixing Perl Warning: Setting locale failed on Mac OS

You might see this while you execute `fisher`:

```sh
perl: warning: Setting locale failed.
perl: warning: Please check that your locale settings:
        LC_ALL = (unset),
        LANG = "en_TW.UTF-8"
    are supported and installed on your system.
```

Edit fish config:

```

+ export LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8
```

## Integrate with nvm

[Node Version Manager](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) - Simple **bash** script to manage multiple active node.js versions

To install or update nvm, you can use the install script using cURL:

```sh
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.34.0/install.sh | bash
```

or Wget:

```sh
wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.34.0/install.sh | bash
```

Then install [fish-nvm](https://github.com/FabioAntunes/fish-nvm):

```sh
fisher add FabioAntunes/fish-nvm edc/bass
```

If node is not loaded at start, create a init script:

```sh
vi ~/.config/fish/conf.d/nvm.fish
```

and enter:

```sh
nvm use node
```

If you always want to use the latest version, use the followed scripts instead:

```sh
nvm install node
# latest npm and yarn
npm i -g npm yarn
```

then try another session.

## Windows alternative

[Cmder](https://cmder.net/) is a software package created out of pure frustration over the absence of nice console emulators on Windows. It is based on amazing software, and spiced up with the Monokai color scheme and a custom prompt layout, looking sexy from the start.
