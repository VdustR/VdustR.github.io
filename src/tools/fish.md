### Fixing Perl Warning: Setting locale failed on Mac OS

You might see this while you execute `fisher`:

```sh
perl: warning: Setting locale failed.
perl: warning: Please check that your locale settings:
        LC_ALL = (unset),
        LANG = "en_TW.UTF-8"
    are supported and installed on your system.
```

Edit fish config:

```sh
vi ~/.config/fish/config.fish
```

Add locale environment variables:

```diff
+ export LC_CTYPE=en_US.UTF-8
+ export LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8
```

## Windows alternative
