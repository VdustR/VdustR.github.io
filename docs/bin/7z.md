## Compress Without Root Folder

This will compress with root folder:

```sh
# Compress ./relative/dir/myFile
7z a -r my7z.7z relative/dir/*
# Uncompress to ./relative/dir/myFile
7z x my7z.7z
```

This will compress without root folder:

```sh
# Compress ./relative/dir/myFile
7z a -r my7z.7z ./relative/dir/*
# Uncompress to ./my7z/myFile
7z x -omy7z my7z.7z
```
